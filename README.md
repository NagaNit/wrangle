# wrangle

Hey reviewer, the previous reviewer is saying I have copied from my own git repo which is (https://github.com/NagaNit) which is ridiculous and flagged me with plagiarism and he asked me to prove that's my account. Before Checking the plagiarism tool I would like to tell one thing, If you found any similar code matches with others like function, loops, assigning variables, and some visualization it is a complete coincidence.
